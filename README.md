## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the 2D Rocket Simulation program implemented in pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The simulation models the motion of a rocket navigating through space under the influence of gravitational attractors. It incorporates principles from Newtonian mechanics, simulating gravitational forces, rocket thrust, and rotational dynamics. The program uses numerical methods to solve the equations of motion and provides an interactive interface for users to control the rocket's movement.

## Overview of the Simulation

The simulation visualizes a rocket moving in a two-dimensional space populated with gravitational attractors (simulating celestial bodies). The rocket is subject to:

- **Gravitational Forces**: Calculated using Newton's law of universal gravitation.
- **Thrust Forces**: Generated by the rocket's thrusters, allowing it to accelerate forward or backward.
- **Rotational Dynamics**: The rocket can rotate left or right, changing its facing direction.

The simulation uses a camera system that pans to follow the rocket, creating the effect of an infinite space. Background stars are rendered to enhance the visual experience and provide a sense of movement.

## Physics Background

### Newton's Laws of Motion

The simulation is based on Newton's three laws of motion:

1. **First Law (Inertia)**: An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a net external force.
2. **Second Law (F=ma)**: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting upon it and inversely proportional to its mass.
3. **Third Law (Action-Reaction)**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

In the simulation, the rocket's acceleration results from the combined forces of gravity and thrust.

### Gravitational Force

The gravitational force between two masses is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:

$`F_g = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}`$

Where:

- $F_g$: Gravitational force
- $G$: Gravitational constant
- $m_1, m_2$: Masses of the two objects
- $r$: Distance between the centers of the two masses

In this simulation:

- The attractors have a fixed gravitational influence, and their masses are implicit in the gravitational constant $G$.
- The rocket's mass is considered constant and normalized for simplicity.
- The gravitational force is calculated for each attractor and summed to determine the net gravitational force on the rocket.

#### Calculation of Gravitational Force Components

The gravitational force is a vector pointing from the rocket towards the attractor. Its components along the x and y axes are calculated using:

$`F_{gx} = F_g \frac{\Delta x}{r}`$

$`F_{gy} = F_g \frac{\Delta y}{r}`$

Where:

- $\Delta x, \Delta y$: Differences in x and y coordinates between the attractor and the rocket.
- $r$: Distance between the rocket and the attractor.

### Rocket Thrust

The rocket's thrust is modeled as an additional force that can be applied in the direction the rocket is facing (forward thrust) or opposite to it (backward thrust).

#### Thrust Force Components

The thrust force components are calculated using:

$`F_{tx} = F_t \cos(\theta)`$

$`F_{ty} = F_t \sin(\theta)`$

Where:

- $F_t$: Magnitude of the thrust force (controlled by the user).
- $\theta$: The rocket's facing angle in radians.

### Rotational Dynamics

The rocket's rotation is controlled by adjusting its facing angle:

- **Rotation Speed**: The rate at which the rocket rotates (controlled by the user).
- The angle is updated incrementally based on the rotation speed and user input.

## Numerical Methods

### Time-Stepping (Euler Method)

The simulation uses the Euler method, a simple numerical technique for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs), to update the rocket's velocity and position over discrete time steps.

#### Equations for Velocity and Position Updates

1. **Velocity Update**:

$`\vec{v}_{\text{new}} = \vec{v}_{\text{old}} + \vec{a} \cdot \Delta t`$

Where:

- $\vec{v}_{\text{new}}$: Updated velocity vector.
- $\vec{v}_{\text{old}}$: Previous velocity vector.
- $\vec{a}$: Acceleration vector (from net forces).
- $\Delta t$: Time step duration.

2. **Position Update**:

$`\vec{r}_{\text{new}} = \vec{r}_{\text{old}} + \vec{v}_{\text{new}} \cdot \Delta t`$

Where:

- $\vec{r}_{\text{new}}$: Updated position vector.
- $\vec{r}_{\text{old}}$: Previous position vector.

#### Implementation in Code

- **Time Step ($\Delta t$)**: A constant value set in the simulation (e.g., 0.1 seconds).
- **Acceleration Calculation**: The net force divided by the rocket's mass (mass is normalized to 1 for simplicity).
- **Incremental Updates**: Velocity and position are updated each frame using the Euler method.

## Detailed Explanation of Formulas and Numerical Solutions

### Gravitational Force Calculation

For each attractor:

1. **Compute Distance Components**:

   $`\Delta x = x_{\text{attractor}} - x_{\text{rocket}}`$
   
   $`\Delta y = y_{\text{attractor}} - y_{\text{rocket}}`$

3. **Compute Distance and Avoid Division by Zero**:

   $`r^2 = (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 + \epsilon`$

   Where $\epsilon$ is a small constant (e.g., 0.0001) to prevent division by zero when \( r \) is very small.

4. **Compute Gravitational Force Magnitude**:

   $`F_g = \frac{G}{r^2}`$
